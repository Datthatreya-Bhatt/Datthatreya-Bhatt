## 🚀 About Me
🎓 Passionate Developer | 💻 Open Source Enthusiast | 🌱 Lifelong Learner  

I love building efficient, scalable, and impactful software solutions.  
Currently exploring **full-stack development**, **AI/ML**, and **DevOps tools**.  

I enjoy solving problems and breaking them down into smaller, logical parts — occasionally breaking my code in the process too, but that’s just part of the learning curve 😄.

## 💡 Fun Fact

😴 I would love to change the world, but they won’t give me the source code.

Until then, I’m happy fixing my own bugs — one commit at a time 🧠💻.
